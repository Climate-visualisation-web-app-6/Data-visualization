In this project we will be visualizing the data for climate change from past several years.
ADVANCED WEB APPLICATIONS PROJECT DOCUMENTATION

Introduction:
We have designed and implemented a data visualization application project. This project deals with displaying temperature and co2 data from thousands of years related to climate change. The project has been informative, efficient, educative and appealing. 

 










Technologies used:
We have used Kanban rule in GitHub by creating our group organization to manage workflow and enable better collaboration.
 

We have used React.js for front end, node.js express for backend, chart.js to plot graphs and react chart.js for chart, Mongo dB for database, used Microsoft excel for converting the raw data from different sources to Csv data in mongo dB and Google cloud platform to deploy React client and Node.js API server. 



Roles and Responsibilities:
This project is done in group by Manish, Esther and Sujata. UI design and Visualisation was done by Manish, database and testing by Esther, and user login, user login and delete user functionality was done by Sujata. 


Architecture and UI plan of application:
Regarding the application's architecture, we can quickly log in using the registered username and password, and users may also delete their details while logging out. We have designed our line graph in a way that it can hide and reveal graph by selecting a particular colour. We have temperature and CO2 data in our UI plan.

About application:
This application runs in node.js installed terminal and JavaScript installed web browser like google chrome.
